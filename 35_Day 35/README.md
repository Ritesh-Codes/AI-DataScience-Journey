## Day 35 â€“ Crosstab

### Assignments

1. **01_crosstab_basics.py**  
   - Created a simple crosstab to analyze the relationship between `Gender` and `Department`.

2. **02_crosstab_multi.py**  
   - Extended crosstab to multiple variables using both `Gender` and `Department` against `Status`.

3. **03_crosstab_normalized.py**  
   - Used normalization to calculate proportions instead of raw counts.  
   - Covered `normalize='index'` (row-wise), `normalize='columns'`, and `normalize=True` (overall).

4. **04_crosstab_with_margins.py**  
   - Added **row and column totals** with `margins=True`.  
   - Demonstrated normalized crosstab with margins.  
   - Built a **multi-variable crosstab with totals** for deeper analysis.
