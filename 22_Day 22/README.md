# Day 22 - Pandas Basics: Series and DataFrame

Today, we began our journey into **Pandas**, one of the most important Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis. We covered:

---

## **Assignment 1: 01_pandas_series.py**
- Learned how to create **Pandas Series** from lists, NumPy arrays, and dictionaries.
- Practiced accessing elements by **index and label**.
- Performed basic **Series operations** like addition, multiplication, and filtering.
- Used **attributes** like `.index`, `.values`, and `.dtype`.

---

## **Assignment 2: 02_pandas_dataframe.py**
- Created **DataFrames** from dictionaries and NumPy arrays.
- Learned how to **select columns and rows** using `[]`, `.loc[]`, and `.iloc[]`.
- Added, modified, and deleted **columns**.
- Understood **basic statistics** with `.describe()` and `.info()`.

---

## **Assignment 3: 03_pandas_dataframe_operations.py**
- Performed **sorting** of DataFrames by columns.
- Applied **filtering** with multiple conditions.
- Learned how to **rename columns** and **reset indexes**.
- Practiced **value counts** and **unique values**.
- Applied **head()** and **tail()** to view data samples.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- Pandas Series are **1D labeled arrays**, while DataFrames are **2D labeled data structures**.
- DataFrame operations are **vectorized** and highly optimized.
- Indexing and selection in Pandas is **more powerful** compared to NumPy.
- Pandas integrates seamlessly with **NumPy** and is widely used in **Data Science & Machine Learning** workflows.

## **Next Step**
Tomorrow (Day 23), we will continue with **more advanced Pandas concepts** like:
- Handling missing data
- GroupBy operations
- Data aggregation
