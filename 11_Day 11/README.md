# Day 11 – Strings in Python

Today’s focus: mastering string manipulation and slicing in Python.

---

##  Concepts Covered

- Creating and accessing strings
- String immutability
- String methods: `upper()`, `lower()`, `title()`, `replace()`, `strip()`, etc.
- Slicing: positive/negative indexing, step slicing
- Checking prefixes/suffixes: `startswith()`, `endswith()`

##  Assignments Completed

1. **01_string_basics.py**  
   → Created strings, printed characters using positive and negative indexes.

2. **02_string_slicing.py**  
   → Practiced slicing techniques and printed sub-strings.

3. **03_string_practice_demo.py**  
   → Used real string methods and slicing on different examples.

##  Reflection

Strings are immutable in Python. Using slicing and built-in string methods makes text processing efficient, especially in data cleaning and preparation tasks for Data Science.
