# Day 10 â€“ Dictionaries and Sets in Python

Today we explored two powerful data structures in Python: **Dictionaries** and **Sets**.

---

##  Assignments Completed

### 01_dict_basics.py
- Created and accessed values in a dictionary
- Added, updated, and deleted key-value pairs
- Used `.get()` to safely access keys

### 02_looping_dict.py
- Looped through dictionary items using `.items()`
- Practiced formatting key-value pairs in print statements

### 03_set_basics.py
- Created sets and saw automatic removal of duplicates
- Used `.add()`, `.remove()`, `.discard()` methods
- Performed set operations: union (`|`), intersection (`&`), and difference (`-`)

##  Key Concepts

- Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs (great for mapping relationships).
- Sets store unique items and support mathematical set operations.
- Both are **mutable** and highly efficient for lookups and membership checks.

##  Real-Life Use Cases

- Dictionary: mapping user data (name â†’ email)
- Set: removing duplicates from a list of emails

ðŸ“Œ This day strengthened our ability to work with structured and unique data efficiently.
