# Day 13 – Python Comparison Operators & Basic Logic

Today’s focus was on understanding **comparison operators**, **basic logical thinking**, and writing small programs to build confidence in conditional logic.

##  Topics Covered:
- Comparison Operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
- Real-world applications of comparisons
- Writing simple logic checkers

##  Assignments

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_comparison_operators.py` | Demonstrates all basic comparison operators with examples |
| `02_real_world_comparison.py` | Simulates real-world comparisons like age check, eligibility check, etc. |
| `03_odd_even_checker.py` | Checks if a number entered by the user is odd or even |
| `04_basic_calculator.py` | Basic calculator using `if` statements for addition, subtraction, etc. |
| `05_even_odd_checker.py` | Another take on odd/even logic to reinforce understanding |

##  Key Learnings
- Logical comparisons form the backbone of condition-based decisions.
- Even simple concepts like odd/even help develop logical flow.
- Practicing small code snippets builds stronger muscle memory in Python.
