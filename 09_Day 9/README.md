# Day 9: Loop Control and Comprehensions

##  Topics Covered
- Loop control: `break`, `continue`
- Nested loops
- Loop comprehension (bonus)

##  Assignments

### 01_break_continue.py
- Practiced controlling loops using `break` and `continue`
- Used loops to filter and stop data flows

### 02_nested_loops.py
- Created a multiplication table using nested loops
- Understood inner vs outer loop flow

### 03_pattern_printing.py
- Used nested loops to print star (`*`) and number patterns
- Built triangle and pyramid shapes using logic

### 04_loop_comprehensions.py
- Rewrote loops using list comprehensions
- Created:
  - Squares list
  - Filtered evens
  - Uppercased words
  - Matrix via nested comprehension

##  Summary
List comprehensions simplify loop-based list creation into clean one-liners. They're readable, fast, and Pythonic.
