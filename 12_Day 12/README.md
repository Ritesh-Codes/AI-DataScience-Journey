# ðŸ“… Day 12 â€“ Sets in Python

Todayâ€™s focus was on understanding and applying the `set` data structure in Python. Sets are useful for managing unique data and performing fast membership tests and set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

##  Assignments

###  01_set_basics.py
- Created and printed basic sets
- Explored automatic duplicate removal
- Demonstrated typecasting from lists to sets

###  02_set_operations.py
- Practiced:
  - `union()`
  - `intersection()`
  - `difference()`
  - `issubset()` and `issuperset()`
- Observed behavior with disjoint sets

###  03_user_access_sets.py
- Simulated user data access scenarios:
  - Users with both trial and premium
  - Only trial or only premium
  - All unique users on the platform

##  Key Learnings

- Sets automatically remove duplicates
- Ideal for membership checking and set theory operations
- Great for user access control and comparison scenarios

---

##  Commands Used

```python
set(), union(), intersection(), difference(), issubset(), issuperset()
