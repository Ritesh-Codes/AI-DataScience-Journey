# Day 19: NumPy Basics â€“ Part 2

Today, I explored more advanced NumPy functionalities including array creation, aggregation functions, and broadcasting.

## Assignments

### 1. NumPy Array Creation (`01_numpy_array_creation.py`)
- Created arrays using `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, and `np.arange`.
- Practiced reshaping and checking array attributes.

### 2. Aggregation Functions (`02_aggregation_functions.py`)
- Used functions like `np.min`, `np.max`, `np.mean`, `np.std`, and `np.sum`.
- Practiced applying these functions on different axes of multidimensional arrays.

### 3. Broadcasting (`03_broadcasting.py`)
- Understood how NumPy handles operations between arrays of different shapes.
- Implemented broadcasting in element-wise arithmetic operations.

## Summary
- Strengthened NumPy fundamentals essential for data manipulation.
- Gained hands-on experience with mathematical operations and shape handling in arrays.
