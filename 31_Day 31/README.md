# 📅 Day 31 – Pandas Joins

Today I learned about **joining DataFrames in Pandas**. I practiced how to combine datasets using different types of joins.

## 📘 Topics Covered

* `join()` in Pandas
* Inner Join, Left Join, Right Join, Outer Join
* Merging DataFrames with keys

## 📝 Assignments

1. **01\_inner\_join.py** – Demonstrated inner join using Pandas.
2. **02\_outer\_join.py** – Practiced outer join with DataFrames.
3. **03\_join\_demo.py** – Hands-on demo of using `join()` with custom data (no CSV files used).

⚠️ Note: I did not create any CSV files for this day. The exercises are purely code-based.
