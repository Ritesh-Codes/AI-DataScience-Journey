# ðŸ“… Day 7: Control Flow in Python

Todayâ€™s focus was on mastering `if/else`, `for`, and `while` loops, as well as using `break` and `continue` to control the flow of logic in Python.

---

## âœ… Concepts Covered

- `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
- `for` loops and `while` loops
- Nesting conditionals and loops
- `break` and `continue` for loop control

---

##  Practice Assignments

### 01_if_else.py
Basic examples using:
- `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Checking number properties (positive/negative, even/odd)
- Grading system logic

### 02_for_loop.py
Practiced:
- Iterating over strings and lists
- Looping with `range()`
- `for` loop for counting and summing numbers

### 03_while_loop.py
Covered:
- Countdown with `while`
- Password retry example
- Breaking infinite loops with `break`

### 04_loop_challenges.py
Applied loop knowledge in mini real-world examples:
- Sum of even numbers from 1 to 100
- Factorial of a number (e.g., 5)
- Count vowels in a string
- Bonus: Print numbers divisible by 3 and 5, reverse a string using a loop

##  Reflection

I now feel confident using control flow to guide decision-making in programs. Writing small logic like factorials, vowel counting, and password checks showed me how powerful loops and conditions are when used together.
